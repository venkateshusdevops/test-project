# Flask CRUD API with MongoDB

This is a simple Flask-based CRUD API for managing items in a MongoDB database. The API provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting items.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed.
- MongoDB installed and running locally or accessible via a URI.
- Docker installed (optional if you want to containerize your application).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/operator-roject.git
   cd operator-roject
pip install -r requirements.txt

Install dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your configuration:

Modify config/config.py to specify your MongoDB URI.
Customize other configurations as needed.
Run the Flask application:


python app.py
The API will be accessible at http://localhost:5000.

Test the API using tools like curl or Postman, or integrate it into your frontend or other applications.
